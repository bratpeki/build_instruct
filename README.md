# Build instructions for various programs

Tested on an Arch-based system (Manjaro), so I presume it works similarly for other ones as well.

## Current list

- [Ardour 6.9](./build/ardour_6_9.md)
- [LMMS 1.3-alpha.1](./build/lmms_1_3-alpha_1.md)
- [ZynAddSubFx 2.5.4](./build/zynaddsubfx-2_5_4.md)

## Thanks

Much of my help comes from:

- [archlinux/svntogit-packages](https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages)
